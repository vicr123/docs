Upon startup, theBeat will scan your Music folder to find any music you may already have. Every time you open theBeat, this scan will be repeated to ensure that the library is up to date.

## Adding Items

If the tracks you want to listen to are not in your Music folder, manually add them to the library. You can do this in one of many ways:

### Drag and Drop

Drag the track from your files into the library.

### Using the menu

Select the menu > Add to Library, and then select a folder. theBeat will scan the entire folder for music tracks and add them to the library for you.
