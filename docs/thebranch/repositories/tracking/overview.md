When you use Git, your changes are saved incrementally in stages. Each stage is called a **commit**, and creating such a stage is called **committing** to the repository.

At any time, you can look back at the commits you have made and retrieve any changes that you have ever committed. You can also find out what changes were introduced in each commit, and when.

Along with files, commits also store information like a short message, the date of the commit and the author. This can be useful in order to create an audit trail, or to create a list of contributors.

You can think of a commit as representing the files on your disk at a specific point in time.
