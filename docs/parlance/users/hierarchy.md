title: The Project Hierarchy
---

Parlance organises available translations into a common hierarchy.

:::info
This is a general overview of the organisation of Parlance, however, specifics may vary depending on what you are translating.
:::

## Projects

Projects are the top level component. Usually, this component will represent an entire application, or an entire library.

## Subprojects

Subprojects come in below projects, and these components generally represent different parts of a project.

For example, there could be a subproject for the application itself, and then another subproject for included plugins.

## Languages

Languages come in below subprojects, and these components identify the specific language that is being translated for each subproject.
